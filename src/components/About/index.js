                Welcome to my page. My name is Curtis Smith, Born and raised in London, Ontario, Canada. I lived in Ottawa for a decade
                where I worked and attended University, graduated from Carleton University for Civil Engineering. About 4 years ago I 
                moved to the city of Toronto to pursue my passions and start my career in IT. I am currently an IT Architect Analyst for TD Bank, 
                and as well as studying to become a full-stack developer.

                I am a lover of anything hockey and football. I have and always will support the Toronto Maple Leafs and will catch the game whenever I can.
                In the summers if not working on my projects you can usually find me at Algonquini Park exploring the back country. My interests are 
                technology, sports, gadgets, architecture, and learning how things work.
